## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood and severity of headaches using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing lifestyle factors such as sleep patterns, stress levels, and occupation, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that help mitigate headache risks and improve overall well-being.

## Key Features
Comprehensive Dataset:
Includes attributes like gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, stress levels, BMI category, and headache frequency/type.

## Machine Learning Models:
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

Preprocessing Techniques:
Data cleaning to handle missing values.
Normalization of numerical attributes.
Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Insights:
Analysis reveals strong correlations between stress levels, sleep quality, and headache risks.

## Results
The Gradient Boosting Machine emerged as the best-performing model with an accuracy of [Insert Accuracy]%.
Significant correlation identified between stress levels and headache risk.

## Requirements
Python 3.8+
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn
